The cognizant-ai-lab/neuro-san repository is a library for building data-driven multi-agent AI networks, where multiple LLM-enabled agents collaborate to solve complex tasks.
Networks are defined using HOCON configuration files, and agents can be extended with tools for actions beyond LLM capabilities (e.g., API calls, web queries, data processing).
The system separates public chat from private data, supports multiple LLM providers, and can run as a Python library, HTTP service, or gRPC service.
Example networks and testing infrastructure are included to help users define and deploy custom agent systems.
